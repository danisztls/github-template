This is a template for repositories hosted on GitHub. It contain templates for issues, PRs and labels.

## Labels
Unfortunately GitHub does not allow us to configure labels as code as is possible with issues and PRs. Fortunately there are tools that allow managing labels from the command line like [batchlabels](https://github.com/sshaw/batchlabels).
